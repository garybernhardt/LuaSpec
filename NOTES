--Why does this work?: table = {a=1}; assert(#table == 0)
--Why isn't this valid syntax?: assert({a=1} != {a=1})

    Bug in manual section 2.2:
    "Like indices, the value of a table field can be of any type (except nil)"
    Values can be nil!

    LANGUAGE NOTES

    1) Using tables as objects seems to disallow the language to (1) define
       table equality and (2) allow sentinel object creation. If empty tables
       are equal, and objects are tables, then two new objects will equal
       each other, so they can't be used as sentinels. If two new objects
       don't equal each other, then table equality isn't defined properly.
